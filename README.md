Mockathon for an escape room experience site

SITE IS VERY INCOMPLETE!!! NO FUNCTIONALITY AT THIS TIME

## Grading System (1-5)
- Creativity/design
- Realistic/feasibility
- Effort/ completion

## Prompt
Alright, you’ve got 2 hours to accomplish the following task to the best of your ability: Build a web page that is also an escape room. If the user had an answer key, the puzzles should be solvable within a couple minutes (no time locks or onerous problems). You can use any site or format that’s convenient but make sure it is easy to share/run for a dummy non-coder. Submit an answer key along with your webpage. Make it awesome.
